# Apparatus Bootstrap

Bootstrapping the Apparatus — a compounding mechanism for making design decisions with structured evidence.

## Orientation

- **[research-guide.md](research-guide.md)** — How we work: methodology, procedures, evaluation criteria
- **[status.md](status.md)** — Where we are: work queue and current landscape
- **[journal/](journal/)** — What we've done: append-only researcher narrative
- **[experiments/](experiments/)** — Practitioner test records with plans, logs, and evaluations

The artifact under development lives in **[apparatus/](apparatus/)**, a nested git repository with its own branch-per-experiment history.
