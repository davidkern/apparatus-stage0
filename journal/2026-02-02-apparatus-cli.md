# 2026-02-02: Apparatus CLI — first dev-quality implementation

Building the first working implementation of the apparatus CLI. Design comes from the 2026-02-01 session, specifically:

- **Specification**: `journal/2026-02-01-git-as-database/design/006 - design.md`
- **Revision notes**: `journal/2026-02-01-git-as-database/design/006 - notes.md`
- **Implementation scope**: `journal/2026-02-01-git-as-database/design/007 - implementation scope.md`
- **Reflection**: `journal/2026-02-01-git-as-database/design/008 - reflection.md`

## Approach

Implementation plan and running notes live in the companion directory rather than this file, so that:

1. **Plan** (`001-implementation-plan.md`) carries the specific context fresh agents need to do implementation work — design decisions, simplifying assumptions, data model, and phase-by-phase build instructions. Self-contained enough that an agent can pick it up without reading the full design history.
2. **Notes** (`001-implementation-notes.md`) captures running commentary, decisions made during implementation, friction points, and observations for future research analysis.

This file stays as a summary log of what happened during the day.

## Log

- Set up journal structure for today's work.
