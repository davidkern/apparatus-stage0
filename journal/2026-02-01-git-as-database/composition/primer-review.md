# Containment model debate feedback


## Investigation

> The gregarious project has a mature investigation skill that treats investigations as self-contained directories with an index file, research entries, and experiment entries all within a single directory tree.

Priming a particular solution. Reference to an irrelevant external system.

## Cross-structural relationships

Seems biased toward an association model by describing the structural relationship between
areas using loaded terms. Suggest describing the behavioral linkages between areas rather than define the representation of the objects in terms of each other.

- GOOD: design spawns investigations to gather evidence for decisions
- BAD decisions reference investigations as evidence

## Instantiation

> Created from a snapshot of existing state

Biased toward compositional model. Should stay with behavioral framing of requirement.

## Evaluation criteria

Too constraining of design space for a debate. Each position should be able to argue from the qualities it feels are important. Specifying the evaluation criteria forces a priori justification from the debater.

## Tension points

Leading... but may be unavoidable to ensure positions produce actionable knowledge.

## Your task

It is not the role of the advocate of a position to expose the weaknesses of their position. That is the role of the designer to judge following the debate.
