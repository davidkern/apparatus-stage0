# Primer neutrality review: fresh agent feedback

## Overall assessment

Moderate bias toward composition (estimated 60/40). The bias is not explicit but cumulative — through framing, word choice, ordering, and emphasis. The association advocate would need to reframe the evidence base itself rather than argue from it.

## Specific findings

### Language bias
- Option A gets a punchy summary ("copy the container") while Option B's snapshotting is framed as work ("requires traversing references and collecting")
- Structure descriptions use containment vocabulary throughout ("contains," "within," "self-contained") — composition's framing is baked into the evidence base
- Tension points use factual language for composition ("these are two separate objects") but conditional language for association ("it could be one shared object")
- "Constantly translate" in structural alignment criterion is loaded

### Prior art imbalance
- Gregarious investigation skill is cited as "mature" and maps directly to composition. No corresponding association precedent is provided.

### Structural issues
- Composition is described first in every tension point (anchoring effect)
- The "most demanding scenario" (hermetic sandbox) maps naturally to composition's mental model without noting that association can achieve the same property

## Recommended changes

1. Rewrite option descriptions to be parallel in structure and implied effort
2. Remove or balance the gregarious reference
3. Replace containment verbs ("contains") with neutral ones ("has," "includes," "tracks") in structure descriptions
4. Alternate which option is described first across tension points
5. Make tension point descriptions parallel — remove conditional hedging from association
6. Soften evaluation criteria wording (drop "constantly translate")
7. Add note after instantiation section that both options can achieve hermetic isolation
