# Interview Q4: Risks and tensions

## Prompt

Read /work/research-guide.md in full. Then answer this single question in 2-3 paragraphs:

**What could go wrong with this approach? What tensions or risks do you see that the document may not fully address?**

Reason critically from what you've read. Where are the weak points?

## Response

**The Practitioner Contamination Paradox**

The most fundamental tension lies in the methodology's assumption that a "clean" practitioner session—one completely isolated from researcher context—can generate reliable data about the quality of `apparatus.md`. The guide explicitly warns against "contaminating" experiments by exposing the practitioner to expectations, evaluation criteria, or meta-commentary. Yet this creates a profound measurement problem: the practitioner's confusion or deviation might not indicate a flaw in `apparatus.md` at all, but rather the artificial constraint of working in an information vacuum. Real users of a knowledge management process don't exist in hermetically sealed sandboxes—they have organizational context, access to examples, colleagues to ask questions, and awareness of why they're doing the work. By optimizing for a practitioner that can execute the process in total isolation, the research risks producing a document that is over-specified, brittle, and fundamentally different from what would actually be useful. The bootstrap might succeed in creating a self-sufficient document while failing to create a useful design methodology.

**The Evidence-First Straightjacket and Compounding Overhead**

The Apparatus demands structured evidence (hypotheses, investigations, experiments, decisions with traced assumptions) for every design choice, positioning this formalization as the mechanism that "raises the floor" for future work. But there's an unexamined assumption that the overhead of this formalization is always worth paying—that every decision benefits from being made explicit, that every assumption merits tracing, that the cost of maintaining this machinery never exceeds its value. The research guide itself contains no mechanism for evaluating when to skip formalization, when to make a quick pragmatic choice, or when accumulated process debt should trigger simplification rather than more refinement. As the Apparatus compounds, there's a real risk of creating a system where the researcher spends more time feeding the machinery than thinking. The "larger abstractions" promised in the purpose statement might instead become layers of bureaucratic process that insulate the researcher from direct engagement with the problem. Most dangerously, the bootstrap methodology has no exit velocity check—no way to detect if the system is becoming a perpetual research project that studies itself rather than a tool that enables other work.
