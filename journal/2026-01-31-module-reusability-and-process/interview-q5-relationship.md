# Interview Q5: Researcher-system relationship

## Prompt

Read /work/research-guide.md in full. Then answer this single question in 2-3 paragraphs:

**What is the relationship between the researcher and the system they are building? Who is the subject and who is the instrument?**

Think carefully about this. The answer may not be straightforward.

## Response

The relationship between the researcher and the system is deliberately paradoxical and mutually constitutive. The researcher is not simply building a tool external to themselves; they are constructing the very apparatus that will elevate their own thinking. The system being built is explicitly described as "the next layer" that raises "the floor the researcher stands on," freeing them "to think in terms of larger abstractions." The researcher uses informal methods to elicit formal knowledge, which then becomes machinery that produces more capable machinery. In this sense, the researcher is both the subject conducting the experiment and the substrate being transformed by it. The system doesn't replace the researcher but augments them, creating a compounding mechanism where each iteration makes the researcher more capable by giving them better tools for making design decisions.

This is why the document frames the work as a "bootstrap problem" analogous to a compiler that must compile itself. The researcher cannot stand outside the system they're building because the very act of building it requires the capabilities it's meant to provide. The practitioner experiments reveal this recursive nature: a researcher writes `apparatus.md` describing a process, then becomes a practitioner following that process, and the friction they experience as practitioner becomes data for the researcher to refine the system. The instrument (the Apparatus) is simultaneously the object under study and the method of study. The researcher is building scaffolding beneath their own feet while standing on it, using the system to improve the system, making each iteration of themselves more capable of building the next iteration of the system.

The answer to "who is the subject and who is the instrument" is therefore: both, simultaneously, in different phases of the research cycle. The Apparatus is the instrument when the researcher uses it to make design decisions with structured evidence. The researcher is the instrument when they serve as the practitioner generating data about what works and what doesn't. But ultimately, the entire assemblage—researcher plus Apparatus—is the true subject, a coupled system bootstrapping itself into higher capability through deliberate iteration.
