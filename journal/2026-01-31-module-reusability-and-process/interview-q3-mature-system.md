# Interview Q3: Mature system inference

## Prompt

Read /work/research-guide.md in full. Then answer this single question in 2-3 paragraphs:

**What do you think the mature version of this system looks like — not what the document says it will be, but what you can infer from the trajectory of the work?**

Speculate based on the evidence in the document. What is this converging toward?

## Response

Based on the evidence in this document, the mature version of this system is converging toward **a self-sustaining research acceleration infrastructure where the primary bottleneck shifts from "how do we make good decisions" to "how do we manage the compound growth of our decision-making capacity."** The bootstrap metaphor is revealing: this isn't building a static tool for documenting decisions — it's building a system that uses its own output (structured decision records with traced assumptions) as input to generate increasingly sophisticated versions of itself. The researcher's role transforms from "person who makes decisions" to "person who operates at meta-levels above decision-making," delegating the mechanics of investigation, experimentation, and evidence synthesis to an apparatus that has internalized the patterns.

What's particularly telling is the staged criteria structure and the "post-stage 1" features like trace links and invalidation workflows. These aren't mere aspirations — they're load-bearing components waiting for the foundation to support them. The system anticipates a future where the volume of decisions, the complexity of their dependencies, and the frequency of assumption invalidation would overwhelm manual tracking. The apparatus becomes a **living dependency graph of design knowledge** where breaking an assumption automatically surfaces every downstream decision that needs reconsideration. The proportionality criterion ("depth matches importance") suggests the mature system will handle portfolios of decisions at vastly different scales simultaneously — trivial choices documented minimally, critical architectural decisions with deep investigation trees.

The real endpoint isn't visible in the stated goals but in the structural choices: the nested git repository preserving experimental conditions, the separation of researcher and practitioner roles, the emphasis on "formal knowledge becomes input to machinery that produces more capable machinery." This converges toward **an automated research lab** where hypotheses about process improvements are tested against practitioner agents, findings are extracted programmatically, and `apparatus.md` evolves through a continuous integration loop of experiment → evaluation → refinement. The human researcher becomes the hypothesis generator and quality arbiter, while the apparatus manages the experimental mechanics, evidence chains, and impact analysis that would otherwise consume all available cognitive bandwidth.
