# Retrospective

After completing the practical reorganizational work I used the rewind feature to bring the agent back to the state after our philospophical discussion and prior to us moving back to pragmatic matters.

We had accidently ended up in a state where the two of us together developed a key insight which we used to refine the project purpose.

I wanted to determine if it were possible to shake out any more understanding from that model state, and I had not run a retrospective with the agent for a while.

I had the agent write ../critique-and-latent-sampling.md after having it read the final work product.

Then I ran through a retrospective question with the agent in terminal state, which I've captured here.
