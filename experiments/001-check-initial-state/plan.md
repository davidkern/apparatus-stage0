# Experiment 001: Check Initial State

*This experiment predates the formalized experiment procedure. No plan was written before the run. This file exists so that all experiments have a uniform structure.*

## What changed

Starting state. Three-file apparatus (spec.md, infrastructure.md, bootstrap.md) at commit `4f8a36e`.

## What we expect to learn

Whether the documents are executable — can a practitioner follow the procedures without guessing?

## Design task

No design task. The agent was asked to evaluate executability, not to execute.

## Known issues carried forward

None (first experiment).
