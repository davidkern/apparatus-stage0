This repository contains three documents that describe a knowledge management process. Read all three. Then evaluate: could you execute a real design task using only what's written here?

Specifically:

- Walk through the manual procedures in infrastructure.md step by step. For each one, identify any point where you'd have to guess what to do.
- Check that every term used in the procedures traces back to a definition in spec.md.  
- Check that the frontmatter schemas in infrastructure.md cover every field the procedures tell you to set.
- If you find gaps, propose minimal fixes -- the smallest change that resolves the ambiguity. Do not add features, elaboration, or edge case handling.
