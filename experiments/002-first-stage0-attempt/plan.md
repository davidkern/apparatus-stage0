# Experiment 002: First Stage 0 Attempt

*This experiment predates the formalized experiment procedure. No plan was written before the run. This file exists so that all experiments have a uniform structure.*

## What changed

Merged spec.md and infrastructure.md into single apparatus.md. Separated researcher content (research-guide.md) from practitioner content. Removed deferred features (maturity axis, trace links, evidence thresholds, proportionality). Fixed procedure gaps found in 001 (frontmatter field enumeration, waiting→open transition, removed orphaned `running` status).

## What we expect to learn

Whether a practitioner can execute the full forward flow — from starting a Design through recording Decisions — using only apparatus.md.

## Design task

Design project conventions for Apparatus-managed projects: directory structure, document naming, frontmatter schema formalization, and how adopting projects reference the Apparatus spec.

## Known issues carried forward

None (first attempt with the merged document).
