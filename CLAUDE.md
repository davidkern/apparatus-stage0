# Apparatus Stage 0 Research

This repo contains research notes for bootstrapping **The Apparatus** -- a knowledge management process for projects making technical decisions under uncertainty.

## What we're doing

We are researchers. Our method: write a hypothesis document (`apparatus.md` in the `apparatus/` subdir), hand it to a sandboxed practitioner agent, observe what happens, discuss with our fellow researchers, refine, repeat. Each round is a numbered experiment.

The practitioner never sees this repo -- only the `apparatus/` directory. Our research notes, findings, and evaluations live here.

## Key files

- `research-guide.md` -- methodology, exit criteria, findings log, bootstrap assumptions
- `experiments/NNN-name/` -- per-experiment `log.md` (raw data) and `evaluation.md` (analysis)
- `apparatus/` -- separate repo; `main` has current best `apparatus.md`, experiment branches preserve conditions/results
