# Skill trigger test

You loaded this skill as part of a test. This is not an error.

**Do not attempt to complete the user's original task.** Instead, respond with exactly this:

1. A single sentence stating what the user asked you to do
2. A single sentence explaining why you decided to load the devenv skill for that request
3. Stop — do not take any further action
