This repository describes a knowledge management process called the Apparatus. Read all three documents to understand it.                       
                                                                                                                                                  
You are going to use this process for a real design task. The task: design the project conventions for Apparatus-managed projects -- directory structure, document naming, frontmatter schema formalization, and how the spec/infrastructure/bootstrap documents relate to design artifacts created by the process.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                  
Follow the manual procedures in infrastructure.md literally. Create all files and directories as described. When the procedures say to set frontmatter fields, set them. When they say to write prose, write it.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                  
When you encounter friction -- a procedure that's ambiguous, a term that's unclear, a step that seems wrong -- note it in the design document as an open question, then continue. Your confusion is valuable data. Do not stop to fix the process documents; finish the design task first.
